# Insurance Agents Performance Analyser

This project provides an end-to-end solution to analyze, predict, and improve the sales performance of insurance agents using machine learning and interactive visualizations. By identifying agents at risk of going “NILL” (i.e., not making any sales in the following month), and categorizing agents based on performance patterns, the solution helps stakeholders take proactive, data-driven decisions.
